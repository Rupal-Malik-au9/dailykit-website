                busy schedules and on demand services are bringing many options
                to consume food to the table. One of the most popular ones are
                Cloud/Virtual Kitchens which has taken the nation by storm.
                <br />
                <br />
                But there’s a downside to this. There have been many Cloud
                Kitchen brands that have sprung up in the past and
                sustainability has been a main concern for these brands.
                Stagnant revenue and loyal customer base is another one but
                there’s light at the end of the tunnel, and lets explore that
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4 className="para2_heading" id="Brand Awareness?">
                  Brand Awareness?
                </h4>
                Virtual Kitchens have always struggled with Brand Awareness as
                they do not have a physical presence. This makes them invest
                more money into Marketing themselves which is good but the
                returns are low.
                <br />
                <br />
                Adding Meal Kits to your vertical will significantly improve
                your Brand Awareness as the Meal Kit Revolution is sweeping the
                nation by storm. You instantly come across as a brand that
                people talk about on Social Media as to how great your dishes
                are
                <br />
                <br />
                Ideally you will be addressing 2 sizable markets in one stroke
                as both have extremely loyal customer bases. The idea of Meal
                Kits makes a lot more sense to a Cloud Kitchen than anyone else
                in the market and its easier to execute for a Cloud Kitchen
                since you already have the technology and operational
                capabilities to deliver them.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4 className="para2_heading" id="Improved Profit Margins">
                  Improved Profit Margins
                </h4>
                Lets face it, Cloud Kitchens do have the cushion of not working
                out of a fancy huge location which exposes your brand to higher
                profit margins. But the recent survey suggests otherwise. Even
                though you do not have to worry about huge physical location
                overheads, you still have to spend money on Marketing.
                <br />
                <br />
                Essentially the money that you save is going back into
                Marketing. So adding another vertical of generating revenue
                makes a lot of sense for Cloud Kitchens. <br />
                <br />
                What better vertical to add than a Meal Kit.
                <br />
                <br />
                You don’t even need a Chef to pack a Meal Kit. It can be done by
                anyone. With Dailykit’s technology, we have made this process
                completely fool proof that even a 10 year old can do it.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4 className="para2_heading" id="Less Riskier">
                  Less Riskier
                </h4>
                Cloud Kitchens can serve a variety of recipes on the platter
                which makes them so unique already. Adding a new recipe or
                removing a recipe from the menu is not a difficult task but a
                bad recipe/bad review can hurt the brand.
                <br />
                <br />
                However unique your recipe might be, you always run into the
                risk of exposing the customer to a recipe he may/ may not like.
                So why don’t you do the soft approach first?
                <br />
                <br />
                Introduce the new recipe as a Meal Kit first. Get your customers
                to taste it as a Meal Kit. Once you have your customers talking
                about your new recipe, you can then include it part of your
                cooked food. This will allow your customers to try their way
                with the Meal Kit and also your way with your cooked version.
                <br />
                <br />
                You win both ways.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now, you are already making great food that people love. Why
                don’t you make Meal Kits out of them? Or even have a seperate
                recipes for Meal Kits as well. The options are endless.
